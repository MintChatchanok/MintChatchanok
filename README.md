👋 Hi, I’m Chatchanok Chalothonpises (But you can called me 'Mint')

🌟 **My Story**

A computational linguist in the making, passionate about how words, data, and algorithms shape the way we understand the world. With a BA in English (MFU, 2020) and an MA in Computational Linguistics (Goldsmiths, 2025), I tried to bridge the gap between human communication and artificial intelligence.

🧩 **My Toolbox**

- **Programming & Data**: Python, SQL, PySpark, Hadoop, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **NLP & ML**: Transformers (T5, BERT, XLM-R), embeddings, sentiment analysis, summarization
- **Big Data & Tools**: Hadoop ecosystem, HDFS, Matplotlib
- **Creative Edge:** Turning linguistic challenges into data-driven storytelling ✨

🚀 **Things I’ve Built**
